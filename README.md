# Subdomainr

Simple subdomains for Rails 2 with easy upgrade to Rails 3.

Modifies the rails 2 router to include routing based on domain and subdomain request attributes and extends the request subdomain attribute to return the string portion of subdomains of predefined domains. You can also add subdomains to ignore -- "www" is ignored by default.
